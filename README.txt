This repo is a collection of some of the projects I have done in my free time, mainly focused on CV tasks, but also including some NLP.

Below here is a link to a google drive folder with the demo videos for the "Raconteur" project (visually grounded chat assistant)
There is a video of just the live frame matching, how a reference video is recorded, and the final experience with the tool in action.
